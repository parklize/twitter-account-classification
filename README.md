# Abstract
Nowadays, the large-scale human activity traces on social media
platforms such as Twitter provide new opportunities for various
research areas such as mining user interests, understanding user
behaviors, or conducting social science studies in a large scale. However,
social media platforms contain not only individual accounts
but also other accounts that are associated with non-individuals
such as organizations or brands. Therefore, distinguishing individuals
out of all accounts is crucial when we conduct research such
as understanding human behavior based on data retrieved from
those platforms. In this paper, we propose a language-independent
approach for distinguishing individuals from non-individuals with
the focus on leveraging their profile images, which has not been explored
in previous studies. Extensive experiments on two datasets
show that our proposed approach can provide competitive performance
with state-of-the-art language-dependent methods, and
outperforms alternative language-independent ones.
